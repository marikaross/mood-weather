# Mood-Weather
An application, powered by the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) that informs the user of current weather conditions based on user input. It was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.  See the docs for Create-React-App [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Primary JavaScript Technologies Used
